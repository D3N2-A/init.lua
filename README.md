# Neovim Configuration Repository

This is a repository containing my personal configuration for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). It includes various plugins such as Telescope, Treesitter, LSP, and Packer.

## Requirements

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [Packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/neovim-config.git`
2. Navigate into the cloned directory: `cd neovim-config`
3. Install the plugins using Packer: `nvim +PackerInstall`

## Plugins

### [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)

Telescope is a highly customizable fuzzy finder plugin for Neovim. It allows you to quickly search for files, buffers, git files, etc.

### [Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)

Treesitter is a powerful parsing tool for code. It provides syntax highlighting, indentation, and more, with a more accurate parsing method than the standard Neovim parser.

### [LSP](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html)

The Language Server Protocol (LSP) is a protocol for building tools to provide code editing features like code completion, go to definition, find all references, and more for a variety of programming languages. Neovim has built-in LSP support, which makes it easy to use with plugins that provide LSP features.

### [Packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

Packer.nvim is a fast package manager for Neovim plugins. It allows you to easily manage your plugins and keep them up to date.
